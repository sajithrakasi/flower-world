      These are the terms most useful to gardeners, whereas classifying by Monocots and Dicots is very basic but is very useful if you are really studying flowers or just want a general understanding of them. Of course the one other big way is by Botanical Names and Classes, etc. But that's for the Botanists.
      hen we try to group flowers into Monocots and Dicots, just remember that there are always exceptions when a flower doesn't seem to be one type or the other. Sometimes there are fusions of petals and leaves and other parts making it very confusing. If ever you find any types of flowers which just don't fit and you want to know their names, it's a good idea to either take a flower to your local Botanical Gardens, or send them a photo. 
      They are really helpful with ID in different types of flowers. Of course the local nursery usually has the ID we want.

   This Portulaca has narrow leaves and the petals are not clearly defined. Because the leaves look like Monocots (not branching), I would have assumed that this was a Monocot. But it is definitely a Dicot Flower as you can see below with the broader leaved form. 
   It is a good example of just how tricky Nature can be. The photo below is much clearer. If you click on it to enlarge it you can see the five petals distinctly. Sometimes, unless you have access to the original baby seed leaves of a flower, things can get pretty tricky.
